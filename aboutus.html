    <p>As a software developer, I want to make a lasting impact on technology.<br><br>
    I'm working hard to find out what that impact will be, by exploring my interests in tech.</p>
    <p>I went to Xavier High School from 2018-2021, where I graduated a year early.<br><br>
    For work, I have been a receptionist at Stoney Point Meadows since 2018.<br><br>
    I also work as a piano teacher, and help my mother at her job as an activities director.</p>
    <p>In middle and high school, I was on my school's FTC team, where I helped program robots.<br><br>
    Working on robots in JavaScript was my first introduction to the coding world.</p>
    <p>I am now a DeltaV student, where I will be increasing my skillset and accomplishing my goals.</p>
